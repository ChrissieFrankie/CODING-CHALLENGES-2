# CODING CHALLENGES 2 :computer::dart:

## Brief overview :memo:

The current repository you're exploring is a collection of coding challenges and solutions that will rev up my data science problem-solving engine. I'll tackle the problem in Python first, then R to gain an appreciation for modern programming languages and actually learn something instead of passing quizes/exams.
I will also explore other skills covered in the domain. 

## Context :chart_with_upwards_trend:

I wasn't impressed with my Data Science instructor. If you're reading this, thanks for the A.

## Scope :telescope:

- The challenges will range from simple to extremely difficult as I progress.
- There will be some math notes to try to deeply understand what is actually going on. 

## Sources :book:

- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard)
- [DataQuest](https://app.dataquest.io/practice)

## Goal :trophy:

- Get a high-paying job to save money to start a business that generates free cash flow to party every day.
- Not become a diversity hire.

## Challenges :mountain:

- Kaggle's Getting Started *coming soon*
